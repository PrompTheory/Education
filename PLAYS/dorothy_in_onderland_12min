## SCENE 1

*Stage: Split level. Upper: sterile medical office with two chairs. Lower: empty black box that will become the telepacube. A single red shoe sits on the medical desk.*

**DR. WIZARD** *(shuffling papers)*: Three months of headaches. Three specialists. Three different diagnoses.

**DOROTHY**: Migraines, they said. Then cluster headaches. Then stress-induced tension. *(touches her temple)* Same pain. Different names. Different pills.

**DR. WIZARD**: The telepacube reads neural patterns. Maps emotional triggers. Shows us what traditional scans miss.

**DOROTHY**: Virtual reality therapy?

**DR. WIZARD**: Virtual reality truth. *(gestures toward the lower stage)* Step inside, Dorothy. Let's find your yellow brick road to holistic recovery.

*Dorothy moves to the black box. Red light begins to pulse.*

**THE VOICE (V.O.)**: Initializing trauma protocol. Patient: Dorothy Gale. Chief complaint: chronic pain, unknown origin, mental stability score approximately 56.9954

*Dorothy closes her eyes. The black box transforms—projection mapping creates a swirling, digital tornado.*

## SCENE 2: THE DIGITAL STORM

*Inside the telepacube. Swirling lights. Digital debris. Dorothy's hospital gown transforms into her iconic blue dress through lighting effects.*

**DOROTHY**: This feels... familiar. Wrong, but familiar.

*The SCARECROW materializes—a flickering hologram made of medical charts and prescription bottles.*

**SCARECROW**: If I only had a brain... that worked properly. That processed pain correctly. That didn't misfire signals through damaged pathways.

**DOROTHY**: You're my headaches.

**SCARECROW**: I'm your body's confused distress call. Listen closer, Dorothy. Feel deeper.

*The TIN MAN appears—composed of X-ray images and MRI scans, hollow inside.*

**TIN MAN**: If I only had a heart... that pumped blood to all the right places. That didn't skip beats when memories surface.

**DOROTHY**: And you're my racing pulse.

**TIN MAN**: I'm circulation disrupted by stored trauma. Touch the rust, Dorothy. Feel the blockage.

*The LION emerges—a shadow figure that grows larger as Dorothy approaches.*

**LION**: If I only had courage... to remember what happened. To face what my mind buried. To name the thing that changed everything.

**DOROTHY**: What thing? What memory?

**THE VOICE (V.O.)**: Neural pathway activated. Accessing suppressed data.

*Lightning effect. The tornado intensifies.*

## SCENE 3: THE REVELATION

*The three figures circle Dorothy. Their forms become more solid, more human.*

**SCARECROW**: The headaches started after the accident.

**TIN MAN**: The heart palpitations began with the lawsuit.

**LION**: The fear crystallized when they said it was your fault.

**DOROTHY**: The car crash. *(realization dawning)* I hit my head. Mild concussion, they said. Nothing serious.

**ALL THREE**: Nothing serious. Nothing serious. Nothing serious.

**DOROTHY**: But something was serious. Post-concussion syndrome. Traumatic brain injury. Symptoms dismissed. Pain delegitimized. Healing interrupted.

*The figures begin to fade as Dorothy speaks.*

**LION**: You found your courage.

**TIN MAN**: You trusted your heart.

**SCARECROW**: You used your brain.

**DOROTHY**: I found the truth.

*The tornado dissipates. Dorothy stands in calm, white light.*

---

## SCENE 4: EMERGENCE

*Back in the medical office. Dorothy opens her eyes, stepping out of the telepacube.*

**DR. WIZARD**: What did you discover?

**DOROTHY**: Not what. When. The headaches aren't random. They mark anniversaries. The crash. The lawyer's letter. The insurance denial.

**DR. WIZARD**: Trauma-triggered pain. Neurological scarring masked as psychiatric symptoms.

**DOROTHY**: Three months of wrong turns. But now... *(picks up the red shoe from the desk)* I know the way home.

**THE VOICE (V.O.)**: Session complete. Diagnosis updated. Treatment plan revised.

**DR. WIZARD**: There's no place like accurate medical care.

**DOROTHY**: There's no place like being believed.

*Dorothy puts on the red shoe. Lights fade except for a warm spotlight on her face.*

**DOROTHY** *(to audience)*: I clicked my heels three times. I said there's no place like home. But home isn't Kansas. Home is inside a body that's been heard. Trusted. Healed.

*Blackout.*

### PRODUCTION NOTES

**Technology**: The telepacube sequence requires sophisticated projection mapping or LED walls to create immersive virtual environments. The three manifestations can be achieved through a combination of live actors and holographic projections.

**Themes**: Medical gaslighting, trauma-informed care, the intersection of physical and emotional healing, the power of patient advocacy.

**Staging**: The split-level stage represents the boundary between physical and virtual reality, between dismissed symptoms and validated experience.
